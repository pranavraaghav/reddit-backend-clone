# Reddit Backend Clone - built with Nodejs

A clone of Reddit's backend API built using Nodejs and TypeScript. 

## Description

I built this project as a learning exercise to get better at building backend systems using Nodejs + TypeScript and to get better at designing and implementing complex database schemas in Relational Databases.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository locally and follow these instructions: 
- Make a ```.env``` file based off of the template provided in ```sample.env```.
- Edit the values in ```ormconfig.json``` to suit your database connection. 
- Install node modules using ```npm install```
- Run the code using ```npm run dev```
